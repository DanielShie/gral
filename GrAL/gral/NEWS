Version 0.2:

- does now work also with gcc 3

- new GrAL modules:
  gral/testing, 
  gral/triang2d,
  gral/complex3d,
  gral/cartesian2d,
  gral/cartesian3d,
  gral/gmv-io, 
  gral/geomview-io

- tutorial on adapting a data structure to the
  GrAL interface was extended


- many additions to gral/base:
  - some tests added (still not enough)
  - isomorphism calculation on grids
  - classes for grid morphisms
  - union view of disjoint grids
  - generic edge and facet support for 3D grids
  - flags and switch operators added consistently
  - new tags for element_traits and grid_traits

- gral/distributed: 
  support for persistent storage
    of distributed grids in files
  test directories added, and bugs fixed

- additions to geometry module:
   intersections of geometric entities, 
   small matrix primitives (norms, condition numbers,
    small linear systems)


- archetype feature for 3D grids
