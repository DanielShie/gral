Version 0.2:

- new modules:
  gral/testing, 
  gral/triang2d,
  gral/complex3d,
  gral/cartesian2d,
  gral/cartesian3d,
  gral/gmv-io, 
  gral/geomview-io

- tutorial on adapting a data structure to the
  GrAL interface was extended


- many additions to gral/base:
  isomorphism calculation on grids, and classes for grid morphisms
  view of disjoint union of grids
  generic edge and facet support for 3D grids
  flags and switch operators added consistently
  new tags for element_traits and grid_traits

- gral/distributed: 
  support for persistent storage
    of distributed grids in files
  test directories added, and bugs fixed

- additions to geometry module:
   intersections of geometric entities, 
   small matrix primitives (norms, condition numbers,
   small linear systems)

- works now with gcc 3
