/*! \mainpage Index of the GrAL Testing Module

    This module contains components for testing
    grid implementations for syntactical and semantical correctness.

    All tests are accessible by including Test/all.h.

    Examples are found in the tests of $gral-gral/complex3d GrAL-Complex3D
    (in test-complex3d-iterators.C)
    and $gral-gral/cartesian2d cartesian2d 
    (in test-cartesian-iterators.C) modules.
