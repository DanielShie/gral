GrAL - The Grid Algorithms Library
==================================

The author can be contacted at
berti@math.tu-cottbus.de .

See the file INSTALL for the installation procedure.

GrAL has been split into several modules, some of 
which have nothing to do with grids per se.
See the file MODULES for a short description of 
the individual modules.

Many common makefile definitions and configuration settings
have been factored out and can be found in the configuration
module.

The documentation is available separately,
but it can also be extracted from the sources.
See the file INSTALL for details.
Please note that the documentation is still incomplete.

If you have questions, suggestions, found a bug,
helpful criticism, or even want to contribute,
do not hesitate to contact me!

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
----------------

The GrAL was developed during my work at the group
Numerical Mathematics and Scientific Computing (NMWR)
at TU Cottbus, Germany, headed by Prof. Bader.
Special thanks go to my colleagues, in particular
Klaus-Dieter Krannich for porting to the SP-2 and 
many helpful criticism and discussions,
and Klaus Schenk, who was the first user in the context
of a Finite Volume solver for the 2D Euler equations.


FUTURE PLANS
------------

The GrAL currently contains only a part of the components
I have implemented. I am working on merging the following
into GrAL (that means, modularizing  and documenting it):

- hierarchical grids and multigrid
- grid refinement 
- simple FEM system (2D Poisson equation)
- simple FV solver  (2D Euler/Two-component Euler/Advection equation)
- concrete components for regular grids and triangulations
