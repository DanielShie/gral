Short guide to building and installing GrAL
===========================================


Building it:
------------
0) Environment:

   - Works with g++ 2.95 (tested on Solaris and Red Hat Linux).
     In principle, any fairly standard compliant C++ compiler
     should do.

   - Makefiles require GNU make. 
     (Seems to be the only way to portable makefiles)

   - Some scripts require Perl. 
     (Not needed for the following steps)

1) Unpack the stuff:
$ tar -xfv gral-all.tar

This will create a directory GrAL (corresponds to ALLROOT in Makefiles).

The preferred place to unpack the documentation is inside 
the GrAL directory (creates doc/ directory).

Most global configuration is found in configuration/ .
You might want to look into configuration/defs/make.defs
and configuration/defs/suffix-targets.
Here, you can set globally compiler and architecture
(needed to select appropriate options).

The following explanation refer to the case that you want to
operate on all modules collectively (should be the normal case
when starting).
If you want to operate on individual modules, there are two choices:
a)  Edit in mk.config the variable ALLROOT 
   to point to the top level directory in the tar file (i.e. GrAL/). 
   [This should hopefully be the only thing to edit in each module ...]
b) Alternatively, add an argument ALLROOT=/path/to/GrAL to gmake calls.


2) Then run from ALLROOT
$ gmake new

This builds some libraries (not all modules produce libraries).
These are written to <module>/lib/<ARCH>/<CCNAME>/<DEBUG>/.

3) Install it:

To install the headers and libraries (not every module
produces a library) in one central place, 
either edit the PREFIX variable in configuration/defs/make.defs,
or call gmake with an additional PREFIX=/your/prefix argument, 
e.g. PREFIX=~/lib/gral/ :

$ gmake install [PREFIX=/your/prefix]

This will copy libraries and header files to PREFIX/lib/
and PREFIX/include, resp.


4) Build tests:

To only build tests, call
$ gmake test [PREFIX=/your/prefix]

To build & perform the checks, call
$ gmake check [PREFIX=/your/prefix]



Documentation 
-------------

Documentation is available separately on the GrAL home page.
If unpacked in GrAL/, the file GrAL/index.html points to the
right location.


In case you want to build it from sources,
note the following:

Code documentation needs doxygen
-> http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html

Concept documentation (in gral/base/doc/hyperlatex) 
needs Hyperlatex 2.3.1 
-> http://www.cs.uu.nl/~otfried/Hyperlatex/
(Does NOT work with the newest version of hyperlatex! 
 This will be corrected in future versions of GrAL.)

To build the documentation, type
$ gmake doc

(to make entire docs)

or
$ gmake doxy 

(to make only source code docs).

This creates in each module docs in doxygen/html.
The file gral/doxygen/html/index.html points to all module
documentations.



Enjoy!
