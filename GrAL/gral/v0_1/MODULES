Short description of GrAL's modules:
====================================

configuration: Some basic config parameters shared by all modules.

utility: Some macros (pre/post-conditions) and some other basic stuff.
         Used by all other modules (except configuration module)

external-control: Classes for controling parameters of classes, by parameter
     files or command line. 
     Used by some test programs.
     Rather well documented (using doxygen and Hyperlatex).

geometry: Basic geometric types and some geometric primitives. 
     Used by gral/complex2d
     Not documented. 

sequence: STL-like stuff. Neither complete nor systematic.
     Used by gral/base, gral/complex2d
     Somewhat documented (doxygen).

gral/base: Basic stuff for grids, mainly generic.
     Used by gral/complex2d
     Documented: 2 Doc trees, one for code (doxygen), 
     one for the generic concepts (hyperlatex)

gral/complex2d: A concrete 2D grid component
     Documented (doxygen)
