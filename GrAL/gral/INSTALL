Short guide to building and installing GrAL
===========================================


Building it:
------------
0) Environment:

   - Works with g++ 2.95 (tested on Solaris).
     In principle, any fairly standard compliant C++ compiler
     should do.

   - Makefiles require GNU make.

   - Some scripts require Perl. (Not needed for the folling steps)

1) Unpack the stuff:
$ tar -xfv <gral>.tar

There is no global build procedure for making all modules at once.
Most global configuration is found in configuration/ .
You might want to look into configuration/defs/make.defs .
Here, you can set globally compiler and architecture
(needed to select appropriate options).

In each module directory, there is a file mk.config.
[These should hopefully be the only files to edit ...]

Near the top, edit the variable ALLROOT to point to the
top level directory in the tar file. 
Alternatively, add an argument ALLROOT=/path/to/top/dir 
to the calls to gmake below.


2) Then run for each module
$ gmake new

and possibly

$ gmake test


3) Install it:

If you want to collect the headers and libraries (not every module
produces a library) in one central place, edit the PREFIX variable
in the mk.config's accordingly, or call gmake with an additional
PREFIX=/your/prefix argument, e.g. PREFIX=~/gral/

Then type
$ gmake install

This will copy libraries and header files to PREFIX/lib/
and PREFIX/include, resp.



Documentation 
-------------

Documentation is available separately on the GrAL homepage.

In case you want to build it from sources,
note the following:

Code documentation needs doxygen
(http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html)

Concept documentation (in gral/base/doc/hyperlatex) 
needs Hyperlatex 2.3.1
(http://www.cs.uu.nl/~otfried/Hyperlatex/)


To build the documentation, type
$ gmake doc

or
$ gmake doxy 



Enjoy!
