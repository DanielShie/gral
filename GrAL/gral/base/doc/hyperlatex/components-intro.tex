In this section, we present a selection of generic components.
A more exhaustive documentation can be found 
in the \xlink{GrAL source index}{\GRALINC{index}{.}}.
(There is some overlap between these two parts of the documentation,
due to ``historical'' reasons.)
At any rate, this part of the documentation is intended to
explain the rather ``theoretical'' issues,
whereas the \xlink{source documentation}{\GRALINC{index}{.}}
documents the ``practical'' state as it is.
