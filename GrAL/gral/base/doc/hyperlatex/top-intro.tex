The Grid Algorithms Library (\xlink{GrAL}{\GRALURL})
is a library for \Glossarylink{generic programming} 
with \glossarylink{grids}{grid} (e.g. Finite Element meshes).
Its aim is to provide grid-based algorithms in a way 
that is completely independent of the data structures
used to represent grids.


The general ideas underlying GrAL
are introduced in \sectionlink{the first part}{Intro}.
The \glossarylink{concepts}{concept} are discussed 
in a more formal way in the \sectionlink{concepts section}{Concepts}.

Some generic and concrete components are presented in the 
\sectionlink{Components section}{Components}.
A more exhaustive documentation can be found 
in the \xlink{GrAL source index}{\GRALINC{index}{.}}.
(There is some overlap between these two parts of the documentation,
due to ``historical'' reasons.)
At any rate, this part of the documentation is intended to
explain the rather ``theoretical'' issues,
whereas the \xlink{source documentation}{\GRALINC{index}{.}}
documents the ``practical'' state as it is.
