Grids are geometric data structures used in many fields
of computational science.
In \sectionlink{the first section}{GridsAlgorithmsAndReuse},
we give a short introduction to the usage of grids
and to the problem of reusing grid-related software.
In \sectionlink{Overview over the Grid Category}{GridIntro}
we list the main components of an abstract grid interface.
This interface falls into 3 sets:
a \sectionlink{combinatorial grid layer}{CombinatorialLayer},
a \sectionlink{data association}{DataAssociationLayer} (or grid function) layer,
and a \sectionlink{geometric layer}{GeometricalLayer}.
