There are several grid classes implemented, 
that conform to the interface described above, 
presented here with varying degree of ``iteration power'':
\begin{itemize}
\item  \sectionlink{\type{RegGrid2D}}{RegGrid2D}, a 2-dimensional
  regular grid, model of \sectionlink{\concept{FullGrid}}{FullGrid},
\item  \sectionlink{\type{Complex2D}}{Complex2D}, a  2-dimensional
  unstructured grid with arbitrary cells, model of \sectionlink{\concept{FullCellGrid}}{FullCellGrid},
\item \sectionlink{\type{Triang2D}}{Triang2D}, a  2-dimensional triangulation
\end{itemize}
Some (not very useful) examples of the iterator features
can be found in a  
\xlink{test routine}{\NMWRROOT/test/Grids/cartesian} 
for the cartesian grid, 
and a  
\xlink{test class}{\NMWRROOT/src/Grids/Complex2D/test-complex.C}
for  the {\tt Complex2D} grid.
