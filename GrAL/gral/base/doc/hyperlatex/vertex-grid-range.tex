\conceptsection{Vertex (Edge, Cell, ...) Grid Range Concept}
\end{Label}

\conceptsubsection{Description}
A {\em Vertex Grid Range\/} is a sequence of objects of type {\tt V}
which is a model of 
\sectionlink{\concept{Grid Vertex}}{GridVertex}.

Virtually the same definitions can be made for the other element types,
replacing {\tt Vertex} with {\tt Edge, Cell} etc.
Therefore, Vertex Grid Range is chosen to stand {\em sui generis\/} for 
Edge Grid  Range, Cell  Grid Range and so on.

The Vertex Grid Range concept is seldom useful as such;
its primary use is to
define further refinements of the basic 
\sectionlink{\concept{Grid Range}}{GridRange} concept: 
Useful concrete grid types generally
will be models of (at least) two different range concepts,
such as Vertex Grid Range and Grid Cell Sequence.

 \conceptsubsection{Complexity guarantees}
 The {\tt r.NumOfVertices()} operation has complexity at most O(V), where
 V is  the number of vertices of {\tt r} \noteref{note-complexity}

 \conceptsubsection{Notes}
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item \notelabel{note-complexity}
   The reason why a general Vertex Range cannot guarantee $O(1)$ complexity for
   this operation is the following: 
   Such a sequence  might arise from a grid range
   given by a simple enumeration
   of its cells 
   (or their handles,
   see for example   \sectionlink{{\tt enumerated\_grid\_range}}{EnumeratedGridRange}).
   The elements of lower dimension belonging to {\tt r} are then implicitely defined
   by the closure (in a topological sense) of the set of cells in the underlying grid.
   The determination of, for example, the set of vertices can be done in expected time
   O(V) (using \sectionlink{\concept{partial grid functions}}{PartialGridFunction}).
   Requiring to do this determination at time of construction of the range would 
   impose the cost of doing so also to clients not interested in this functionality.
\item \notelabel{note-size-of-sequence} This functionality can always be implemented
   in terms of the element iterators, in which case it is $O(n)$. In some cases,
   there is no better implementation possible, for example, if edges or facets
   are implicitely ordered by there vertex sets. Therefore, there is no guarantee
   for a better complexity here.
   In these cases, it is not always simple to provide an \tt{EndElement()}
   past-the-end iterator, without compromising efficiency of iterator comparison.
