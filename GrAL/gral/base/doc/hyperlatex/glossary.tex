\begin{Glossar}
\item[associative copy]
  An associative copy between two grids is a copy operation
  which preserves (outputs) a mapping between the elements of the first and
  those of the second grid, such that this mapping is (part of) a 
  \Glossarylink{grid morphism}.

\item[boundary facet] See \Glossarylink{interior facet}.

\item[bound to a grid] 
  We say that a grid entity \variable{e} of type \type{E}
  is bound to a grid \variable{g}
  if \variable{g} is an object of type \type{E::grid\_type} 
  and \code{\&g == \&(e.TheGrid())}.
  Here \type{E} might be a \Glossarylink{model} of 
  \conceptlink{Grid Element}{GridElement},
  \conceptlink{Grid Function}{GridFunction} or the like.

\item[category]
  is used to denote a group of related components
  which implement concepts from the same problem domain, such
  as grid-related components (grid category), which has 
  sub-categories combinatorial grids, grid functions (or data association),
  and grid geometries.

\item[component]
  A component is any piece of code which can be used elsewhere,
  for example a class template, a single class, a set of related classes,
  or a function implementing an algorithm.

\item[concept]
  Following to the 
  \xlink{STL}{\STLURL} parlance
  a concept is a set of type requirements.
  Generic algorithms require their arguments to be \glossarylink{models}{model}
  of certain concepts.
  The STL documentation explains further:
  \begin{quote}
    Concepts are not a part of the C++ language; there is no way to declare a concept in a
    program, or to declare that a particular type is a model of a concept.
  \end{quote}

\item[dimension-homogeneous]
  A grid element is called {\sl principal\/} if it is not incident to a higher dimensional element.
   A grid is dimension-homogeneous, if each principal element is of
   the highest dimension (namely, the dimension of the grid, $d$).

   This property excludes for example isolated vertices,
   or `free' edges (if the dimension is at least $2$).

\item[geometric realization]

\item[grid morphism]

\item[interior facet] A facet $f$ is called interior with respect to a cell set 
  $C$ (which is assumed to be a sub-range of a manifold-with-boundary grid),
  if there two different cells in $C$ which are incident to $f$.
  If there is exactly one cell in $C$ incident to $f$, then $f$ is a
  {\sl boundary facet\/} of $C$. If there is no such cell, $f$ is not a facet 
  of $C$.

\item[manifold-with-boundary]
  A combinatorial grid of dimension $d$ is a manifold-with-boundary grid,
  if it has a {\sl \Glossarylink{geometric realization}} which is a manifold with boundary.

\item[model]
  A concrete type is a model of a \Glossarylink{concept},
  if it fullfils the requirements of the concept.

\item[partial specialization] refers to binding a part of the parameters 
  of some generic component (class template) to some more specialized type.
  For example, consider the fully generic template frame for 
  \conceptlink{total grid functions}{TotalGridFunction}:
  \begin{example}
  template<class E, class T>
  class grid_function<E,T> \{\};
  \end{example}
  In generic algorithms, this serves as a placeholder for the actual implementations of 
  \type{grid\_function} for concrete element  types \type{E}.
  For example, total grid functions for the \sectionlinkfoot{\type{Complex2D}}{Complex2D}
  grid type are implemented by using vectors for the element types \type{Complex2D::Vertex}
  and \type{Complex2D::Cell}, and by using hash tables for the element type \type{Complex2D::Edge}:
  \begin{example}
  template<class T>
  grid_function<Complex2D::Vertex, T> 
    : public \sectionlinkweb{grid\_function\_vector}{grid-function-vector}<Complex2D::Vertex, T> \{
    // repeat constructors
  \};

  template<class T>
  grid_function<Complex2D::Cell, T> 
    : public \sectionlinkweb{grid_function_vector}{grid-function-vector}<Complex2D::Cell, T> \{
    // repeat constructors
  \};

  template<class T>
  grid_function<Complex2D::Edge, T> 
    : public \sectionlinkweb{grid_function_hash}{grid-function-hash}<Complex2D::Edge, T> \{
    // repeat constructors
  \};
  \end{example}

\item[poset]
A (strict) poset ${\cal S}$ is a {\bf p}artially {\bf o}rdered finite {\bf set}, 
that is, a set with a partial order $<$ 
which is antisymmetric and transitive. 
The poset of a grid consists of the grid's elements,
partially ordered by inclusion.

A poset is {\sl bounded\/} if there are unique minimal and maximal elements
$\hat{0}$ and $\hat{1}$.
A {\sl chain\/} is a totally ordered subset of a poset. A bounded poset
is called {\sl graded\/} if every maximal chain has the same {\sl length}
(its number of elements minus 1). 
For $ a \leq b$, the {\sl interval\/} $[a,b]$ 
is the set of all elements in between:
\[
  [a,b] = \{ c \in {\cal S} | a \leq c \leq b \}
\]
If ${\cal S}$ is graded, the {\sl rank\/} of $a \in {\cal S}$ is the length
of a maximal chain in $[\hat{0},a]$.

The poset of a grid ${\cal G}$ can be made into a bounded one by adjoining
the {\sl improper elements\/}  $\hat{0} = \emptyset$
and $\hat{1} = \|{\cal G}\|$, with dimensions $-1$ and $d+1$.

  
\item[publishing a type] means a standard way of associating types with classes.
  One way to do it is to use nested typedefs within the class, like in the following
  example from the STL:
  \begin{example}
   template<class T>
   class vector \{
   public:
     typedef T  value_type;
     typedef T* iterator;
     ...
   \};
  \end{example}
  Here the class template \type{vector} publishes \type{value\_type} and \type{iterator},
  which can be used in another component:
  \begin{example}
    template<class Container>
    void f(Container const& C, Container::value_type const& t) {
      Container::iterator i = C.begin();
      // ...
    }
  \end{example}
  Another way to look at it is to say that \type{vector<T>} defines
  a mapping from type \type{vector<T>} to a set of associated type like
  \type{vector<T>::iterator}.

  A different and somewhat more flexible way of achieving this is using so called
  \webref{traits}{\traitsURL}{Meyers95}
  classes, which makes use of several different such mappings
  for a given type possible. For this purpose, responsibility for the type definitions
  is delegated to a separate class, the {\sl traits class}.
  \begin{example}
   template<class C>
   struct container_traits \{\}; // default: empty

   // specialize for vectors
   template<class T>
   struct container_traits< vector<T> > \{
     typedef T  value_type;
     typedef T* iterator;
     // ...
   \};
  \end{example}
  If the algorithm {\tt f} above continues to be parameterized by {\tt C} alone,
  not much changes, only the occurences of {\tt C::iterator} has to replaced by
  {\tt container\_traits<C>::iterator}.
  On the other hand, one might imagine a {\sl counted iterator}, which counts the number
  of increments. It would not be easy to introduce this without traits.
  However, we can use an additional traits parameter to the algorithm {\tt f}:
  \begin{example}
    template<class Container, class Traits>
    void f(Container const& C, Container::value_type const& t, Traits const&) {
      Traits::iterator i = C.begin();
      // ...
    }
  \end{example}
  Now it is possible to introduce counted iterators, without any change to the algorithm
  implementation:
  \begin{example}
  template<class C>
  struct counted_traits {
    typedef C::value_type value_type; // use same value type
    typedef counted_iterator<C::iterator> iterator;
    // ... 
  };

  // use f, count increments
  MyContainer myc;
  typedef counted_traits<MyContainer> my_traits;
  
  f(my_c, t, my_traits());
  \end{example}
  In the grid component framework, the template \type{grid\_types<>}
  plays exactly the r{\^o}le of \type{container\_traits<>} above.

  A similar effect could be achieved by deriving from the container class,
  or defining a wrapper class with a delegation mechanism, which would contain
  the changed typedefs. However, this would not work for built-in types,
  and also not for aggregations (containers of containers), because there is no
  way of changing the type of contained items.
