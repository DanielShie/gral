    <h1> Introduction to the GrAL </h1>

    GrAL is the  <FONT color=0000ff>Gr</FONT>id 
                <FONT color=0000ff>A</FONT>lgorithms
                <FONT color=0000ff>L</FONT>ibrary.
    It contains generic algorithms and data structures
    working on grids (or meshes), such as used in finite element modelling,
    but also in computer graphics, geometric modelling and so on.
    It also contains some concrete grid data structures,
    but the focus is clearly on the generic (data-structure neutral) stuff.

     GrAL consist of 
    <UL>
      <LI> a growing number (currently 4) of grid-related modules,
      <LI>  some low-level support modules,
        which are not part of GrAL in a proper sense, 
        but are used at some places.
    </UL>
   <EM> GrAL is very much work in progress.
      The contents (especially grid-related modules) are not very
    complete at the moment, and are expected to grow quite a bit.

    For an in-depth treatment of the concepts underlying GrAL, 
    see Guntram Berti's 
    <A HREF="http://www.math.tu-cottbus.de/~berti/diss"> PhD dissertation </A>.
     <BR>
     <BR>
    Look <A HREF="$GRALDOC/gral/doxygen/html/index.html"> here </A>
    for the top level entry point to the technical documentation of
    all (support and GrAL) modules.

    There is currently no tutorial of how to use GrAL's generic 
    algorithms. (This is certainly an urgent TODO.) 
    However, if you are acquainted with other generic libraries,
    especially <A HREF="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/table_of_contents.html"> BGL </A> 
    (formerly <A HREF="http://www.lsc.nd.edu/research/ggcl/"> ggcl </A>),
    you should have no major problems. 
    A good place to start
    is the <A HREF="doc/gral/base/doc/hyperlatex/html/top.html"> concepts </A>
    section of this documentation.
