    <h1> Introduction to the GrAL </h1>

    GrAL is the  <FONT color=0000ff>Gr</FONT>id 
                <FONT color=0000ff>A</FONT>lgorithms
                <FONT color=0000ff>L</FONT>ibrary.
    It contains generic algorithms and data structures
    working on grids (or meshes), such as used in finite element modeling,
    but also in computer graphics, geometric modeling and so on.
    It does contains some concrete grid data structures,
    but the focus is clearly on the generic (data-structure neutral) stuff,
    mainly algorithms.
    <BR>
    GrAL's ultimate aim is to provide implementations of algorithms 
    which are <EM> as generic as possible </EM>,
    that is, work on any grid data structures satisfying the minimal requirements
    of the algorithm.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    See the file 
    <A HREF="README"> README </A> for some general information.
    Up-to-date information on GrAL can be found on the
    <A HREF="http://www.math.tu-cottbus.de/~berti/gral"> GrAL Home page </A>.

    <H3> Contents of GrAL </H3>
     GrAL consist of <A HREF="$GRALDOC/gral/doxygen/html/index.html"> 
      several smaller modules </A>:
    <UL>
      <LI> a growing number (currently 4) of grid-related modules,
      <LI>  some low-level support modules,
        which are not part of GrAL in a proper sense, 
        but are used at some places.
    </UL>
   <EM> GrAL is very much work in progress.
      The contents (especially grid-related modules) are not very
    complete at the moment, and are expected to grow quite a bit.
    </EM>

  <H3> Understanding GrAL </H3>
    For an in-depth treatment of the concepts underlying GrAL, 
    see Guntram Berti's 
    <A HREF="http://www.math.tu-cottbus.de/~berti/diss"> PhD dissertation </A>,
    and the documentation of 
    <A HREF="$GRALDOC/gral/base/doc/hyperlatex/html/top.html"> GrAL's concepts </A>.
    Look <A HREF="$GRALDOC/gral/doxygen/html/index.html"> here </A>
    for the top level entry point to the more  technical documentation of
    the modules.
     <BR>

    It can certainly do no harm if you know some other generic libraries,
    above all the STL (of course), or
    the <A HREF="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/table_of_contents.html"> 
      Boost Graph Library (BGL) </A> 
    (formerly <A HREF="http://www.lsc.nd.edu/research/ggcl/"> GGCL </A>).

    <H3> Using GrAL </H3>
    First, of course, you have to install GrAL, following the
    instructions in <A HREF="INSTALL"> INSTALL </A>.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    If you want to use GrAL, you typically have to adapt your own data structures
    to satisfy the interface expected by GrAL's generic components.
    (At present, GrAL does not provide many sophisticated grid data structures.)
    There is a  (still incomplete)
     <A HREF="$GRALDOC/gral/base/doc/hyperlatex/html/AdaptingToInterface.html"> 
     tutorial </A> of how to do this.
     I think that with the help of more elaborate template wrapper,
     the task of adapting data structures to GrAL
     can  be eased substantially.
