GrAL - The Grid Algorithms Library
==================================

GrAL is a generic library for grid (or mesh) data structures 
and algorithms operating on them. 
It has been inspired by the success of the STL, 
and is similar in spirit to BGL and (though to a lesser extent) to CGAL. 
As you might guess, GrAL is written in C++.
